# Dice Game Project

A simple multiplayer dice game in Python. Players take turns rolling dice to reach a target score.

## What It Does

- Lets 2-4 players take turns rolling a dice.
- Each turn, players choose whether to roll again or end their turn.
- Rolling a 1 ends the turn with no points; other rolls add to the turn score.
- First player to reach the target score wins.

## What I Learned and Used

- Python basics: functions, loops, lists, and input validation.
- Writing clear, interactive CLI programs.
- Managing player states and turns in a multi-player game loop.
- Structured a complete, playable project from scratch.
